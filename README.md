# Indian Railways Performance Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **performance of Indian Railways** using **Power BI**, providing insights into **revenue trends, passenger data, train delays, and freight performance**. The interactive dashboard enables **data-driven decision-making** by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).

## 🚀 Features
- **Revenue vs. Cost Analysis** – Compares estimated cost and revenue across different train types.
- **Train Type Distribution** – Shows the proportion of **Freight, Express, Passenger, Superfast, and Local trains**.
- **Monthly Revenue Trend** – Tracks revenue fluctuations across months.
- **Geospatial Revenue Analysis** – Visualizes revenue generated by **origin and destination stations** on a map.
- **Train Delay Analysis** – Identifies average delays across different train types.
- **Passenger Count Trends** – Analyzes seasonal trends in passenger numbers.
- **Interactive Filters & Drill-Throughs** – Allows users to filter data by **train type, year/month, and origin station**.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Freight trains generate the highest revenue (₹55M) but experience the most delays (63 min avg.).**
- **Passenger traffic peaks in August and September, impacting revenue trends.**
- **Ahmedabad to Bangalore is one of the highest revenue-generating routes.**
- **Total Revenue: ₹232M | Total Passengers: 0.91M | Freight Weight: 0.05M**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard design
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom calculations & measures
- **Geospatial Mapping** – Location-based revenue insights
- **Business Intelligence (BI)** – KPI tracking and performance monitoring

## 📂 Dataset Information
- The dataset includes details on **train types, revenue, passenger count, delays, and station-wise performance.**
- Data was cleaned and processed before being visualized in Power BI.

## 🖥️ How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Open Power BI Desktop** and load the `.pbix` file.
2. **Interact with filters** to explore revenue, delays, and performance trends.
3. **Analyze key insights** using the various visualizations.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- **Integrating SQL** for advanced data processing.
- **Adding predictive analytics** for revenue forecasting.
- **Enhancing UI with additional drill-through pages.**
